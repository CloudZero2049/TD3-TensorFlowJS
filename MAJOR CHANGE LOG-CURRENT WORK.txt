[CURENT WORK] Version 0.03

1) Two mini-projects have been completed: Find Target and Run From Zombie. Each will be found in their respective folders.

2) [General Work Update 12/18/23]: I've been hard at work trying to optimize the "Run From Zombie" setup. I've gotten some models to 70% efficiency but there is some sort of NaN error happening over time and I'm narrowing down the issue. I want a 90%+ success rate with the current setup that includes sensors. My goal is to make something that can be generalized to a bigger play area with more enemies before moving on.

[11/25/23] 
1) "Find Target" version 0.02 complete.

[11/28/23]

1) reduced agents actions back down to 2 actions [moveX, moveY].

2) Created a "Train From Memory" button. This directly trains the agent "episodes" number of times. The agent does not act.

3) created a new method of training. The "Record User Actions" will store user input and states into the memory buffer. Then, you can use the "Train From Memory" 
  button to directly train the agent from the memory (agent does not act).

[11/30/23] 
1) "Run From Zombie" version 0.03 complete.

2) Re-organized GitHub project directories so that each mini-project can have it's own folder.
