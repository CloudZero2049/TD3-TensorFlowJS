2) Created a "Train From Memory" button. This directly trains the agent "episodes" number of times. The agent does not act.

3) created a new method of training. The "Record User Actions" will store user input and states into the memory buffer. Then, you can use the "Train From Memory" 
  button to directly train the agent from the memory (agent does not act).
