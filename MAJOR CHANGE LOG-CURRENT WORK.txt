[CURENT WORK] Version 0.08

1) Two mini-projects have been completed: Run From Zombie (V0.06) and Find Target (V0.07). Each will be found in their respective folders.

2) [General Work Update 2/7/24]: 
  2a) I figured it would be best to learn about fine tuning the models on something simple, so I did so on the Find Target setup using the ray-casting system. I chose that method because it is easy to generalize to different purposes. I was finally able to get the Find Target model to 99-100% success rate.
  2b) At this point I might dabble a bit with the new Find Target trained model to see if it can find multiple civilians continually without episode breaks in between. Maybe It will be a time trail to see how many it can get.
  2c) (After maybe doing 2b) I will be going back to the Run From Zombie setup to see if I can improve it with the new fine tuning methods.
  2d) (After 2c) The next step, naturally, will be to finally give the agent a way to fight back against the zombie. The good news is I already have exstensive knowledge and code to do that.


[MAJOR CHANGE LOG]
[11/17/23] : Memory upload/download implemented

[11/20/23] : Model upload/download implemented

[11/25/23] : Action Replay implemented

[11/25/23] 
1) "Find Target" version 0.02 complete.
2) version 0.03 and work on "Run From Zombie" Started.

[11/28/23]

1) reduced agents actions back down to 2 actions [moveX, moveY].

2) Created a "Train From Memory" button. This directly trains the agent "episodes" number of times. The agent does not act.

3) created a new method of training. The "Record User Actions" will store user input and states into the memory buffer. Then, you can use the "Train From Memory" 
  button to directly train the agent from the memory (agent does not act).

[11/30/23] 
1) "Run From Zombie" version 0.03 complete.

2) Re-organized GitHub project directories so that each mini-project can have it's own folder.

[12/21/23]
1) I added a "Test Agent" button that will test the actor_main model (without training or saving to memory).
2) Because of the "Test Agent" button I can now include trained actor_main model data files in the build folders to be used as examples.

[2/7/24]
1) Uploaded final Find Target V0.07 with a 99-100% accurate model and increasing version to V0.08.
