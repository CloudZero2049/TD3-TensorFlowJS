[CURENT WORK] Version 0.03

1) Two mini-projects have been completed: Find Target and Run From Zombie. Each will be found in their respective folders.

2) [General Work Update 1/16/24]: I decided to upgrade the "Find Target" setup to version 0.06 before moving on to the next project. Durring this I realized something was wrong because it was much harder to train than it should have been based on the first sucess in the earlier version. I believe I narrowed down the culprit to haveing too many nodes in the hidden layers of the networks. I'm currently investigating this, but have had sucess lowering the number already.


[MAJOR CHANGE LOG]
[11/17/23] : Memory upload/download implemented

[11/20/23] : Model upload/download implemented

[11/25/23] : Action Replay implemented

[11/25/23] 
1) "Find Target" version 0.02 complete.
2) version 0.03 and work on "Run From Zombie" Started.

[11/28/23]

1) reduced agents actions back down to 2 actions [moveX, moveY].

2) Created a "Train From Memory" button. This directly trains the agent "episodes" number of times. The agent does not act.

3) created a new method of training. The "Record User Actions" will store user input and states into the memory buffer. Then, you can use the "Train From Memory" 
  button to directly train the agent from the memory (agent does not act).

[11/30/23] 
1) "Run From Zombie" version 0.03 complete.

2) Re-organized GitHub project directories so that each mini-project can have it's own folder.

[12/21/23]
1) I added a "Test Agent" button that will test the actor_main model (without training or saving to memory).
2) Because of the "Test Agent" button I can now include trained actor_main model data files in the build folders to be used as examples.
