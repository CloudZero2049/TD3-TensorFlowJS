1) This series of models was trained using a hybrid method of player input to help the agent learn the general method to use when running from the zombie. 
I did this because it turns out it's really difficult to get AI to run in a circle when being chased by something, even when giving a penalty for touching walls (which itself is hard to implement because 
touching the zombie is a terminal condition that ends the episode and would be more rewarding than sitting on a wall)
2) 50 episodes of neer-perfect player controled actions were recorded straight to memory
3) next, the entire system was directly trained on those 50 episodes. The agent quickly learned that making circular movements was the way to go.
4) and finaly, the system was trained like normal for 500 episodes until the agent could survive for 256 steps most of the time (90% +). I tested an episode of 1000 steps just before uploading and the agent survived.
  4a) I lowered gamma (the discount / exploration factor) to 0.25 at 325 episodes.
  5a) I lowered gamma further to 0.1 at 400 episodes.
