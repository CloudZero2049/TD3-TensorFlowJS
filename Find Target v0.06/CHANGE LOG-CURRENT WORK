[CURENT WORK] Version 0.06 . Find Target V6

1) Trained using updated V-0.06 (first was V-0.03)

2) This one isn't perfect, but I'm having sucess tinkering with hidden layer nodes.


[CHANGE LOG]

[1/6/24]

1) removed distance from observation space
2) removed all coords except the agent's from observation space (relying on the rays now).

[1/15/24]

3) removed rays detecting walls.

4) increased memory buffer from 100k to 150k

5) Lowered the hidden layer node count to 32 (down from 512...yah). This appears to have worked very well.

[Random Notes]

is leakyRelu better than Relu?
