[CURENT WORK] Version 0.09 . Run From Zombie V9


[CHANGE LOG]

[2/7/24]

1) Started finetuning a model based on 128 hidden nodes. Setting L2 to 0.1 had the biggest impact for better performance.

2) Finetuned reward function

3) Finally, 99-100% sucess rate models!

4) updating version to 0.08

5) begining work on a "Marathon Mode" which allows the agent to try and find many civilians in one go.

6) Created marathonMode.js to handle marathon logic. It's basically combining code from userTraining.js with the TD3 actions.

[2/8/24]

1) created a "marathon mode" that allows the agent to try and collect as many civilians as it can within the step count.

[2/22/2024]

1) rewarked reward function to get distance from aray detected targets instead of simply the offset value (which was based on the ray length).

[2/25/2024]

1) Increased maximum gamma to 0.999.

2) Warmup now causes random actions for that many steps.

3) Unless testing, gausian noise will always be added to agent actions. (From what I understand it was supposed to be like this the whole time).

[3/1/2024]

1) activeTraining is now true if agent.memory.cnt is higher than the agent.warmup amount (it was using trainstep causing the warmup to trigger again when memory is reloaded).

2) currentStep now starts at 1. (for breaking while loop after max steps reached).

3) Fixed rays not making detections on first step (they were defaulting to 1).

4) created a new error thrown when memory buffer size is smaller then batch size (It was failing silently).

[3/2/2024]

1) An error will now be manually thrown if you try to load memory that has a higher memory size than the current agent memory max size.

2) Downloaded memory no longer saves the agents max memory size (unused variable).

[3/3/2024]

1) as per the original paper, isDone will now only be triggered if the terminal state is caused before
	reaching the horizon (maximum steps in the episode).

2) Critic loss functions will now pull from the same group data instead of having seperate generations of them (this is how it always should have been).

[3/6/2024]

1) Max batch size raised to 640

2) Increased version to 0.09

[3/7/2024]

1) Increased max steps to 10,000 primarily for testing purposes of long single episodes.

[3/18/2024]

1) Added a button to log the final loss of each run for Actor, Critic, and Critic 2

[3/20/2024]

1) Added a button to log memory used in replay buffer.

[4/2/2024]

1) Change the "Start TD3 AI" button to "Train TD3 AI"

[4/3/2024]

1) Updating random spawns to spawn a little further from walls (preventing boxed-in spawns).

2) New spawns boost success to 99%. Run From Zombie is complete.
