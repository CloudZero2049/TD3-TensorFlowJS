1) reduced agents actions back down to 2 actions [moveX, moveY]. I'm worried that taking the absolute value of the second pair for speed (ultimately the movement itself) was interfering with learning.

2) Created a "Train From Memory" button. This directly trains the agent "episodes" number of times. The agent does not act.

3) created a new method of training. The "Record User Actions" will store user input and states into the memory buffer. Then, you can use the "Train From Memory" button to directly train the agent from the memory (agent does not act).

1) stoped training first hybrid model system
