1) A highlight of this version is the new "Test Agent" button that will test the actor_main model being used (does not train or save new information to memory).
  This means I can start including trained model data into the build folders.

2) Trained actor_main info: 
  2a) Reward info: Being far enough away fro mzombie = +2, too close to zombie = -1, touching a wall OR the zomibe = -2 (termal conditions). 
      Yes I got tired of the agent waling into walls and making it a terminal condition actually worked, so yay.
  2b) Starting values: alpha = 0.0004, beta = 0.0005, gamma = 0.90. 
  2c) after 400 episodes I realized that the agent was "wobbling." I'm certain that it was because it wouldn't be penalized if it was moving fast enough even if it was going
    towards the zombie. I fixed that by comparing its current and last known distance, and also wether it was moving fast enough away.
  2d) hyper perameters changed after 1200 episodes: alpha = 0.0005, beta = 0.0006, gamma = 0.97
  2e) At 1700 episodes with a 48% success rate I realized that the agent was doing what it was supposed to except it would run to an optimized policy area.
    It is at this point that I set the gamma (discount factor) to 0.50, and trained it for a simple 10 steps. It quickly converged on an optimal policy with a very high sucess rate (finally!).
    To top it off I trained it another 10 episodes (for a total of 1730 episodes) with a gamma of 0.40, reaching a 96% to 99% win rate.
    This high success rate was also tested with successfull solid 1,000 step runs (which basically means it can survive indefinetely).
  2d) because of early reward error the agent still has a "wobble." It is quickly becoming a trademark of the first successfull build (not including the sub-optimal configuration of the older version) for 
      Run From Zombie. I will make one last attempt at a model without the wobble, and that will be it for this type of "Run From Zombie" model builds.
  2e) (NOTE) Any depictions that appear from the path that the agent chooses to move in is purely coincidental and was not intended by the developer.
