[CURENT WORK]

1) Trying to find out why agent isn't learning. Reguardless of iterations, the agent maintains the same negative reward score, even though sometimes he gains some points.

2) next: trace the choices the agent is making.

[CHANGE LOG]

1)game.js[line 57]: Added console.info(tf.memory()); 

2) changed all basic numbers into scalers durring math because .mul() and .add() requires tensors.
