[CURENT WORK]

1) Trying to find out why agent isn't learning. Reguardless of iterations, the agent maintains the same negative reward score, even though sometimes he gains some points.

2) problem seems to remain even after I suposedly fixed the updating of models.

3) next: trace the choices the agent is making. The actor_targetactions are changing but only by very small amounts (to five decimal places, 0.99995). I looks like the agent ends up choosing the same action every time.

[CHANGE LOG]

[11/5/23] game.js[line 57]: Added console.info(tf.memory()); 

[11/5/23] changed all basic numbers into scalers durring math because .mul() and .add() requires tensors.

[11/5/23] Add creation of deep copies of objects to prevent reference contamination.

[11/6/23] Added a "dummy" visual representation of where the agent/player starts.

[11/6/23] Hopefully fixed the updating of all models (applying gradients and so forth). 

[11/6/23] set target model compile loss to MSE (it doesn't matter from what I understand, because I'm using custom training and loss)

[11/6/23] erased some unused comment code
