1) Find Target V0.07 was trained using rays to detect where the "target" civilian is.
2) I've been fine tuning the model on this and got it to an average 99%-100% success rate after training about 2,000 episodes (trained actor model included in files). 
3) I did not use user-trained memory for this model, it started with zero memories (I also did not use the "Train From Memory" button).
4) Finding a good number of nodes for the hidden layers, setting the L2 regularizer to 0.1 and fine tuning the reward function had the biggest impact on success.
4) Various training info:
  alpha = 0.0001 
  beta = 0.0002
  tau = 0.0005
  gamma = 0.99
  
  steps = 128
  batch_size = 64
  neurons per hidden layer: 128
  kernelRegularizer: L2: 0.1
  Find-Target reward: +2
