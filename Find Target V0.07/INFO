1) Find Target V0.07 was trained using rays to detect where the "target" civilian is.
2) I've been fine tuning the model on this and got it to a 90% (90/100 wins) success rate at 1,000 episodes (trained actor model included in files). 
3) The other 10% can mostly be atributed to the agent being too far from the target to get enough data.
4) Before training the agent I recorded 200 episodes of human-controlled data into the memory (I did not use the "Train From Memory" button).
5) Various training info:
  alpha = 0.0001 
  beta = 0.0002
  tau = 0.0005
  gamma = 0.99
  
  steps = 128
  batch_size = 64
  neurons per hidden layer: 128
  kernelRegularizer: L2
  Find-Target reward: +50
